Two people play this game with:
- alphabet-cards  
- bags including letters  

Each card consists of 8 English letters. The first 4 ones are ranged from A to N, while the others are ranged from O to Z. 
At the beginning of the game, each card (stack) should be randomly filled with distinct values. So, the letters in one stack should be different from each other.

There is a bag1 (stack) that initially includes all English letters. The program selects a letter from this bag randomly and removes it from the bag1. Each player deletes that letter from his/her stack. Selected letters are added to another bag (stack), named bag2, so the next letter is selected from the remaining letters. 

When a person deletes the first or last 4 letters, he/she gets the award $10. (“birinci çinko”)
When a person deletes all letters from the stack, he/she wins the game lotto and gets $30. 
If both players delete their last letter at the same time, they game is over without any winner (tie) and they share the money.

The program displays all steps until the game is over. 
At the end of the game, the winner is displayed, if exists.
The money that each player gets also is printed.
